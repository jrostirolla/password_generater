# Password Generator

## Description
In the attached link, you will find my live password generator. With this application, a user can ask my program to create a unique password, generated completely at random, with a simple press of a button. 

## Instructions
* First, select which type of characters you would like in your password. You can select either lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers or special characters
* After this, you will have to press on the "generate password" button. This will activate a prompt, asking you to specify how many characters you would like in your password. The user must select a number between 8 and 128, otherwise the code will not run.
* After selecting the desired characters, the user is free to select the given password and use it for their desired purpose.

## Challenges
In this exercise, the main challenge came from making the program collect the correct information from prompts. After a bit of experimentation, I found that asking the user to select the desired characters through prompts presented too many variable for the prompt to be a feasable solution to the problem. After this, I decided to use a selection system in the browser instead, as it gave the user a more static choice in their character output, and stopped user error from jamming up the code.
