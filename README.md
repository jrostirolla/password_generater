## Instructions
* First, select which type of characters you would like in your password. You can select either lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers or special characters
* After this, you will have to press on the "generate password" button. This will activate a prompt, asking you to specify how many characters you would like in your password. The user must select a number between 8 and 128, otherwise the code will not run.
* After selecting the desired characters, the user is free to select the given password and use it for their desired purpose.
